# Predicting Ship Propulsion Power using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

Introduction

This project belongs to master's thesis of the Inter-Institutional MSc entitled "Artificial Intelligence" that is organized by The Department of Digital Systems, School of Informatics and Communication Technologies, of University of Piraeus, and the Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications of NCSR "Demokritos". url: "https://msc-ai.iit.demokritos.gr/en".Project explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to predict ship propulsion power. By incorporating physical laws into the neural network training process, we aim to improve the model's predictive capabilities and assess whether PINNs offer advantages over purely data-driven models.

The code has been created with the use of python version 3.12.2. In order to recreate the same working enviroment (and to ensure trouble-free code execusion) it is advised to run under virtual enviroment that should be created with the use of requirements.txt (attached).
